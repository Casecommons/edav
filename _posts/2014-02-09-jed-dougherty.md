I used Assignment 0 as an opportunity to brush off all those
javascript skills I never had and learn a little bit about d3.
My thought process was that this graph was a great opportunity
to show how the population of america has shifted to where the
industry of the era was booming.

I think I'll write up a full blog post about the difficulties I
had in making this and the things I learned if anyone else in the
class is interested. But for now I'll just post links to the actual
visualization, and to my code.
