## Goals

- What are you doing here?
- What kind of data do you have to explore?
- What kinds of models?

</section>

<section>
# but wait…
*What do you already know how to do?*

<section>
## Maxim
Visualizing is modeling, and modeling is software development.

## Tools
- General-purpose
  - R
  - Python
  - Julia
- Modeling
  - Stan/jags
  - Julia

</section>
	<section>
## Acquiring data
- csv
- tables like excel
- databases with sql
- APIs
- json
- xml, html

</section>
	<section>
## Manipulating inside modeling tools
- reshaping
- subsetting, nesting, faceting
- joining to other data
- multidimensional array structures

</section>
	<section>
## Fitting models
- specifying inputs
- specifying models
- looking at the right outputs
- doing something with them
- checking the model
- displaying model + data

</section>
	<section>
## Displaying models
- graphs in interactive editor
- interactive graphs in live session
- presentation graphs
- output to right formats
- output to browser

</section>

# Objectives
(Incremental steps toward the goals)
</section>
	<section>
### Learn *enough to be dangerous* about the modern high- and low-level languages and libraries
- What's relevant for you!
- I use lots of R and Python
- I sometimes write models in Stan
- I sometimes use google docs to make csv editable

</section>
	<section>
### Master the everyday, mundane but indispensible…
…tools of the trade: 

- text editors
- version control (git)
- the command line

</section>
	<section>
### Practice iterative and collaborative
(yes, even Agile) development of your projects

</section>
	<section>
### Initiate and participate in code and project reviews
</section>
	<section>
### *Fail early, learn from it, and ask for help*
</section>
</section>

# After class
- Make a Github account if you don't already have one
- Fork the repo — your blog posts will be in the form of pull requests!
- Add various blogs to your aggregator
